# NXT-Robot-Pathfinder
Spiral search and deliver algorithms implemented in RobotC.

This project enables an NXT Mindstorms robot to traverse a simulated mine field.

The robot will:
* Search the mine field in a spiral pattern.
* Look for a "mine" around itself.
* Pick up a "mine" once found.
* Deliver it to a finish zone.
